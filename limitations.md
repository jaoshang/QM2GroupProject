## Limitations of our datasets

**1. Use of historical data**

Due to difficulties in accessing property websites APIs, we have conducted our analysis using a historical dataset. Despite remaining valuable to recognizing long-term trends and patterns, this dataset might not fully capture the current situation as the housing market is dynamic, and therefore subject to rapid changes.

**2. Endogeneity**

Endogeneity is observed when there is a complex cause-and-effect relationship between different variables, in that it appears unclear which one influences what. In this context, changes in rental prices could affect the supply or demand for housing, leading to reverse causation.

## Limitations of our analysis

**3. Housing configuration ambiguity**

Our rent data set identifies various types of housing configurations, ranging from one bedroom, to studio, to four or more bedrooms. This last arrangement encompassess more than one specific number of rooms (might include five, six, seven rooms configurations), making it harder to define rent per single tenant for comparison. To tackle this problem we have decided to limit the '4 or more bedrooms' to four bedrooms only, meaning that our rent analysis overestimate prices for that housing configuration.

**4. Restricted connectivity mapping**

For the connectivity analysis, we have chosen to consider transport accessibility of different boroughs to UCL only, to narrow our focus and avoid mapping potentially 5 more areas to connect to other London universities. This however poses a limit to our analysisâ€‚in that we might fail to recognise trends that would have emerged from the consideration of routes to other universities.
