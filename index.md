Hi I'm Eurus Li, a sophomore in Arts and Sciences, majoring in Science and Engineering and minoring in Societies. My research directions are archeology and economic management, and I'm interested in global real-time news and international situations. I also enjoy hanging out with friends and traveling during the holidays. I come from Beijing China, and I think London has given me something very similar to my hometown. I guess I will continue my study and life in the UK.

Hi! I'm Joash, a 2nd year in BASc on the Societies Pathway. I'm 22 this year and my hometown is Singapore. I enjoy travelling and outdoor activities, with rock climbing, hiking, scuba diving and hopefully soon-to-be skydiving being some of my hobbies/interests. Academically, my interests centre around International Relations, Sociology, and Psychology, and I'm taking Spanish as my language. Notably, I enjoy the field of security studies, especially using ethnography and studying security issues through the lens of human security. I am trying to brush up on my quantitative skillset on the side, especially Python using Mimo, which is sorta like Duolingo for coding.
