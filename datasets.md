## <span style="color: #D35400 ;">Average Private rents, Borough – Valuation Office Agency</span>

This first dataset provides average monthly rents in the private rental market and includes:

<strong>1. Mean, median and quartiles of monthly rents</strong>

<strong>2. Housing configurations associated with these rents</strong>

<strong>3. Borough to which these prices are linked</strong>

It is an historical dataset that was updated quarterly up to 2013, and bi-annually until the last entry in 2019. The dataset contains valuable information for our rent price analysis will allow us to geospatially map rent price distribution and later understand the affordability of rent based on location and housing configuration.



## <span style="color: #D35400 ;">Recorded Crime: Geographic breakdown – Metropolitan Police Service</span>
The second datasets provides counts of crime per month and includes:

<strong>1. Crime type</strong>

<strong>2. Borough to which these crimes are linked</strong>

This is also an historical dataset, but appears less clear than the rent data, facing problems such as double counting of crimes that will be addressed in the process of data cleaning. Nevertheless, the data will allow us to assess the safety of each borough, which, integrated with the rent price analysis, will add another dimension to student’s decision making process.

<strong>1. Mode of Transport</strong>

<strong>2. Commute Time</strong>
