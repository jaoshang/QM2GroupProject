<p align="center">This research project delves into the intricate landscape of university student housing in London, aiming to enhance our understanding of the dynamic rental market and its impact on students' decision-making processes when seeking accommodation. The central research question revolves around identifying recurring patterns in rental trends, factors influencing prices, and challenges faced by students in their housing search.</p>


## <span style="color: #D35400 ;">Purpose & Motivation</span>

The surge in international student enrollment in London universities, coupled with the persistent high demand and inelastic supply of housing in London, and the growing cost of living crisis in the UK, has fueled a competitive housing market marked by escalating prices.
Attracting the attention of policy makers and institutions, this issue is extremely relevant in current times, becoming a recurring experience of new and returning university students every year. The project seeks to address the pressing concerns of university students, occupied with questions of where and when to look for accommodation, and what general factors to look out for when searching for housing.

## <span style="color: #D35400 ;">Aims & Objectives</span>
The primary aim of this research is to unravel patterns that can streamline the student accommodation search process, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making. To achieve this, the project sets out to:

 <p align="center"><strong>Collect comprehensive data</strong></p>

Utilize datasets from property websites, Statista, and student accommodation platforms to compile information on rental prices, property features, and geographic locations.

**Geospatially Analyse**

Map rental prices in London boroughs, focusing on areas surrounding key universities to ensure relevance to the student population.

**Integrate Key Indicators**

Integrate additional factors such as crime rates and transportation accessibility to provide a holistic understanding of the housing market.

**Statistically Analyse**

Employ statistical methods to analyze indicators such as averages and medians, unveiling central trends in rental prices and their correlation to other variables.

A successful completion of this project promises to deliver in-depth insights into the challenges faced by London's diverse student population. By providing a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing student housing choices, the research aims to be a valuable resource for policymakers, institutions, and students alike, facilitating more informed and strategic decisions in navigating the intricate landscape of London's student accommodation.

## <span style="color: #D35400 ;">Approach</span>
Our approach follows three key themes: affordability, transport connectivity, and crime. Taking rent as our key variable, we will be looking at historical data to assess the changes in prices over time and across Londonâ€™s boroughs. Our rent data set, sourced from the UK-London government, provides key information regarding rental prices for various housing configurations across the city, that have been geospatially mapped for trend-identification. Taken this visual representation, a GOVUK recorded crime dataset for London, as well as commute time and travel options data obtained through Google Maps API have been integrated to analyse safety and connectivity.
