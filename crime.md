From the graph, we can interpet the following:
  - City of London is the safest borough near UCL, with 24.3k crimes.
  - Westminster is the most dangeour borough near UCL, with nearly 250k crimes.
  - Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith and Fullham are relatively safe boroughs near UCL, with around 78k crimes each.
  - Camden is ranked quite highly, with 130k crimes, more than Croydon. However its notoriety maybe somewhat exaggerated, with Lambeth, Tower Hamlets, and Newham having more crime and being on par with Southwark.

## Yearly Crime

The trends identified above hold true for a yearly analysis bounded from 2021-2022. (Due to 2020 and 2023 having missing months)


## Crime in 2023

A monthly analysis maintains the findings. Notably, it can be observed that crime increases during the summer months. Some implications of this:
  - Greater care should be taken during these months.
  - International students who return home for the summer may be able to avoid such crime.
  - Houses left unoccupied by such summer travelling may be at greater risk of crime.
