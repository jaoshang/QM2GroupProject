## <span style="color: #D35400 ;">Regarding rent</span>

Through the comprehensive analysis of rental prices, property features, and geographical locations in London, our study revealed several key findings that shed light on the challenges and patterns associated with university student housing.

One-bedroom apartments appear to be the most common type of accommodation in London, with two-bedroom apartments coming in second. Third most popular are three-bedroom homes, with four-bedroom or more dwellings, separate rooms, and studio apartments having lower rental prices. In general, the tendency shows that rental prices decrease with an increase in tenants, which is closely correlated with shared living areas.

The existence of outliers is an intriguing finding, especially when it comes to larger or four-bedroom homes. This anomaly may be explained by overestimating pricing due to an assumption made in leasing procedures. But even after taking this possible overvaluation into consideration, the median rent for four-bedroom or larger homes is still quite modest.
Independent rooms are the most affordable choice, whereas studio flats and one-bedroom units are more expensive because they have separate amenities. Three-bedroom apartments are a potentially cost-effective option since they strike a balance between affordability and facilities, whereas two-bedroom units are positioned in the middle of the market in terms of availability and price. Interestingly, three-bedroom flats balance price and number of rentals.
The most popular and reasonably priced housing type is two-bedroom apartments. On the other hand, the most costly accommodations are studio flats and one-bedroom units, which appeal to people who want total control over their space and exclusive access to the amenities. While independent rooms are the least expensive, they don't have private facilities.In conclusion, there is a wide range of options available in the London property market, each of which takes budget and preference into account.

Compared to the other boroughs, the City of London can be seen as the safest area away from UCL, while Westminster is considered to be the riskiest borough near the university. In this respect, Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith and Fulham are relatively safer.
Camden has a relatively high crime rate, even more so than Croydon. However, it is worth noting that its poor reputation may be somewhat exaggerated, as in comparison Lambeth, Tower Hamlets and Newham have higher crime rates, even at the level of Sutherland.

Consideration of the results of the monthly analysis reveals an increase in crime during the summer months meaning that more care needs to be taken during that period. It may be possible to avoid such crimes for international students who return home for the summer, although empty rooms as a result of summer travel may be at greater risk of certain crimes.

In terms of violent crime, the City of London and Richmond upon Thames show the lowest rates, while Croydon and Westminster have the highest ones. Taken together, these findings suggest that choosing to live in the City of London may be a preferred option for UCL students, but more vigilance may be required in Westminster. When choosing housing, the trend of rising crime over the summer needs to be taken into account, especially for unoccupied houses.

## <span style="color: #D35400 ;">Regarding connectivity</span>

People usually prefer homes that are close to their workplace or schools to shorten their commute. This explains why home prices are usually higher near downtown or business centers. The closer a property is to a transportation hub, tube station or bus stop, the higher the home price will generally be. People are willing to pay higher house prices for convenient transportation connections, especially for those who need to commute downtown on a daily basis. Additionally, the availability of nearby bike paths, walking trails, and other green transportation options may also play an important role in housing choices for environmentally and health-conscious residents.
