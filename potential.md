## Digital Platforms and the Rental Market

With the continuous growth of digital platforms in the rental market, further research can investigate the impact of online platforms on students' housing behaviours. This includes understanding how they influence rental pricing strategies and market competition.

Analysing rental pricing models on digital platforms (e.g. Zoopla, Rightmove) would allow us to further explore their impact on pricing strategies in the rental market. This could include the impact of advertising on the platform driving rents, for example dynamic pricing and seasonal variations, to examine how these models are influenced by different factors and their potential impact on student rental strategies.

In relation to long and short-term rental markets, we could explore the distinct roles of digital platforms in traditional long-term and short-term rentals (e.g. Airbnb), and their impact on the student housing market. Furthermore, an analysis of how platform penetration differs between these markets would assess any resulting variations in rental prices and housing options.

## Residential Experience Surveys

Further research can focus on conducting surveys to understand students' perceptions and satisfaction regarding different housing features and community environments. This could offer a detailed understanding of factors influencing student housing choices and contribute to enhancing the overall residential experience.

## Sustainable and Green Housing

Future research could also delve into the role of sustainable and green housing in the student housing market. This could include investigating student demand for environmentally friendly housing and the impact of such housing on rental prices.

## Socio-economic impacts

Lastly, going beyond our research aim and subjects/audience (students),an in-depth study of the socio-economic impacts of student housing is a compelling area. This could relate to the contribution of student-rented housing to the local economy and the impact of changes in the housing market on the socio-economic structure of the community as a whole.
